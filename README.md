Music genre classification using convlolutional recurrent neural networks and transfer learning on the GTZAN dataset

"model.py" contains the base CRNN, the extended CRNN, and the architecture with transfer learning.

The base CRNN is based on the architecture proposed in "https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04555".

For convinience you can also use the notebook.

You can find the project report in the repository.
